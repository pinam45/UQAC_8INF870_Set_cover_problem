Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

The algorithm uses a set of heuristics to find prime covers, another set of heuristics to find feasible solutions to the dual linear program which are needed to generate cuts, and subgradient optimization to find lower bounds. It also uses implicit enumeration with some new branching rules. Each of the ingredients was implemented and tested in several versions. The variant of the algorithm that emerged as best was run on 55 randomly generated test problems (20 of them from the literature), with up to 200 constraints and 2000 variables. The results show the algorithm to be more reliable and efficient than earlier procedures on large, sparse set covering problems.},

Such correlationstructures are contained in a wide variety of real‚Äêworld problems including many scheduling,design, and location applications.
