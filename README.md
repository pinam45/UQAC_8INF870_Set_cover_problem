# 8INF870 - Set Cover Problem

## Information

This repository contains everything produced for our project of algorithm (lecture 8INF870, UQAC) on the Set Cover Problem (SCP).

There are three folders:

- `solver`: contains all the code of our SCP solver.
- `nomad`: [NOMAD](https://www.gerad.ca/nomad/) configurations and scripts to optimize parameters of our approached methods.
- `documents`: report and presentation LaTeX sources (french).

## Build the solver

Don't forget to pull the submodules with the repository using ``--recursive``:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/pinam45/UQAC_8INF870_Set_cover_problem.git

or if you have already cloned the repository:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To build the project you will need a C++17 compliant compiler. The project uses CMake to build, see [Running CMake](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/) for more information.

On linux, a common CMake use is:

	$ mkdir cmake-build
	$ cd cmake-build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make


On Windows, there is batch files available to configure a Visual Studio project in the ``ide`` folder.
